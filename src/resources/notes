After employabilit event, check in with Clayton and Moad to get them up to speed with the progress we made - make sure they've actually had the chance to learn something and not just sit back and let things happen

Figure out how to extract data from API call for weather 
    Just one day to begin with
    Move to 5 days after 

    const weather =({ 
    day: {api-weather.day},
    date: {api-weather.date},
    ...
    )}
    FOR EXAMPLE

Figure out how to convert either UNIX time or dt_txt into better looking time   
    Wednesday 22 Feb for example

Link search in navbar change locations ---> needs to hook into API call
